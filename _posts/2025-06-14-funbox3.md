**Machine:** Funbox3 by @0815R2d2  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Objective:** Boot2Root — gain root access and retrieve the flag.

## Enumeration

### Rustscan

We start with a quick port scan using Rustscan for speed:

```
rustscan -a 192.168.1.6
```

### Nmap

Once we know that ports 22, 80 and 33060 are open, we run nmap for more details.

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- 192.168.1.6
```

### FFUF — Web Fuzzing

Using `ffuf`, we discover several directories:

```
ffuf -u http://192.168.1.6/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

Discovered paths include:

- `/store/`
- `/store/admin.php`
- `/gym/`
- `/secret/`

## Initial Access

Navigating to `/store/admin.php`, we try default credentials:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

It works! Inside the admin dashboard, there’s a feature to **“Add Book”**, where you can upload a cover image. The upload field does not validate file type strictly.

### PHP Reverse Shell Upload

We upload a PHP reverse shell in the "description image" field, with our local IP and port configured:

Set up a listener using `nc -lvnp 4444`, and access the uploaded file via the `/store/` interface. Shell received!

## User Escalation

We explore the system and find a file `/home/tony/passwords.txt` containing credentials for the `tony` user.

![Passwords File](/assets/images/funbox3/password%20file.png)

We use these to log in via SSH:

```
ssh tony@192.168.1.6
```

---

## Privilege Escalation

Once logged in as `tony`, we check sudo permissions:

![Sudo -l](/assets/images/funbox3/privesc.png)

Upon checking GTFOBins, we find that the `/bin/time` binary can be used for privesc via:

```
sudo /usr/bin/time /bin/sh
```

We get a root shell!

## Root Flag

Navigate to `/root/` and read the flag:

```
cat /root/root.flag
```
