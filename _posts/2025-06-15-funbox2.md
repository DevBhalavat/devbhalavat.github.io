## Enumeration

### Rustscan

A fast port scan is initiated using `rustscan` to identify open ports:

```
rustscan -a 192.168.1.8
```

![Rustscan](/assets/images/funbox2/0-rustscan.png)

### Nmap

Based on the initial scan, ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), and 80 (HTTP) are open. We run `nmap` for a deeper analysis:

```
nmap -sC -sV -p21,22,80 192.168.1.8
```

### Web Directory Fuzzing

To explore the web server, we use `ffuf`:

```
ffuf -u http://192.168.1.8/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

The results reveal minimal content on the website.

## Initial Access

### FTP â€” Anonymous Login

Given the presence of an FTP server, we attempt anonymous login:

```
ftp 192.168.1.8
```

- **Username:** `anonymous`
- **Password:** *(leave blank)*

![FTP](/assets/images/funbox2/3-ftp.png)

Several `.zip` files and two hidden files, `.@admin` and `.@users`, are available. After downloading, we find that `.@admin` is base64 encoded. We decode it using:

```
base64 -d .@admin
```

The contents suggest these are backup RSA key archives. The zip files are password protected, so we attempt cracking with `fcrackzip` but with no success.

We switch to `zip2john` and `john` with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

This reveals credentials for users `tom` and `cathrine`. We proceed to SSH using Tom's private key:

```
ssh tom@192.168.1.8
```

## Privilege Escalation

Upon login, we find ourselves in a restricted shell (rbash). We escape this by upgrading to a normal bash shell:

Attempting `sudo -l` initially prompts for a password. After inspecting `.mysql_history`, we discover a stored password:

```
xx11yy22!
```

![MySQL History](/assets/images/funbox2/8-mysql_history.png)

Using this password, we run `sudo -l` again, which confirms that Tom has sudo privileges.

We escalate privileges to root and capture the final flag.
