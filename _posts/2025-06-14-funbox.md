## Initial Enumeration

I began the assessment with `rustscan` to quickly identify open ports on the target machine.

Following this, I conducted a targeted `nmap` scan on ports **21, 22, 80, and 33060** to gather detailed information about the running services.

## Web Application Analysis

While the scans were running, I examined the website hosted on port 80. The homepage revealed that it was running **WordPress**, so I decided to enumerate it using `wpscan`.

The scan identified two valid WordPress users: `admin` and `joe`.

## Credential Discovery and Access

Using `rockyou.txt`, I performed a password brute-force attack and successfully discovered the passwords for both users.

After obtaining the password for `joe`, I established an SSH session into the machine.

## Post-Exploitation Enumeration

Inside `joe`'s home directory, I discovered a `.mbox` email file. The content mentioned a **backup script** shared with a user named `funny`.

Upon inspecting the backup script, I noticed that it was world-writable and used to back up the website. This script was likely executed periodically via a scheduled job (e.g., cron).

## Privilege Escalation via Script Hijack

I modified the script to include a **reverse shell** payload, then set up a listener on port 4444. After a short wait, the payload was executed, and I received a connection.

## Root Access and Flag Capture

The incoming connection turned out to be a **root shell**, confirming successful privilege escalation.

Finally, I navigated to the `/root` directory and retrieved the flag.
